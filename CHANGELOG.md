# Revision history for abc

## 0.4.0.0 -- 2025-08-21

* Chapter 4 tests pass and I got chapter 3 extra credit in. Given the way the AST/IR is generated, I didn't need to generate single-byte registers for the set commands. I'd like to do that once the test suite really starts depending on it.

## 0.3.0.0 -- 2025-08-21

* Chapter 3 tests pass, no extra credit yet. Would also like to clean up code.

## 0.2.0.0 -- 2025-08-21

* Chapter 2 done, with decent amounts of refactoring done as well.

## 0.1.0.0 -- 2025-08-19

* Chapter 1 is done! Still really hacky and code needs cleanup/refactoring but it works.
